If you wish to scale the data, use Pipeline with a StandardScaler in a preprocessing stage. To reproduce the previous behavior:

from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(with_mean=False), Lars())

If you wish to pass a sample_weight parameter, you need to pass it as a fit parameter to each step of the pipeline as follows:

kwargs = {s[0] + '__sample_weight': sample_weight for s in model.steps}
model.fit(X, y, **kwargs)
